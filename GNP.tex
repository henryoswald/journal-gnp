\begin{abstract}
We study the interferences of two or three gold nanoparticles under the illumination of a free-electron laser. 
While one single gold particle could be too weak to be imaged, imaging multiple partciles is more feasible owing to the intensity enhancement from interferences. 
Such enhancement would greatly help the coherent diffraction imaging, and could be a remedy for the imaging of weak-scattering objects.

\section{Introduction}
While the coherent diffraction imaging has been widely employed to investigate the inner structure of non-crystalline weak object such as biological samples or nanoparticles, limited by the flux of current beam sources, some even weaker objects are still diificult to be imaged. 
In order to investigate such kind of samples, some approaches have been proposed and demonstrated. For example, Lan et. al. presents a counter-intuitive method that heavy atoms can be used to enhance the biological samples without adding noise \cite{template}; Kim et. al., on the other hand, experimentally demonstrate that some ``reference objects'' added to the sample can greatly improve the image quality \cite{ref-obj}. 


\section{Sample preparation and experiment set-up}

The experimental results were collected in two separated beamtimes at SPring-8 Anstrom Compact Free Electron Laser (SACLA). 
The first experiment was performed at BL2, where 40-nm and 5-nm streptavidin conjugated Au particle were enclosed in a micro-liquid cell \cite{liquid-cell}, and the camera length was 1.3 m. 
The second experiment was performed at BL3, where 20-nm Au particles were also enclosed in a micro-liquid cell, and the the camera length was 1.5 m. 
The photon energy was 4000 eV, the pulse duration was approximately 10 fs and the photon flux is about $6.225\times 10^{24}$ photons $\mu$m$^{-2}$sec$^{-1}$, beam spot diameter being 1.5 $\mu$m \cite{xfel-ssr}.

The concentration of our liquid samples was carefully adjusted to maximize the probability of hitting only one single or few GNPs. 
Prepared solution was dipped and sealed in the micro-cell, which is fabricated on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, and the samples were mounted in the Multiple Application X-ray Imaging Chamber (MAXIC). 
Single-shot speckle patterns were recorded with a $2400\times2400$ CCD dector, which has a central aperture to allow direct beam passing through.

\section{Results and discussion}
The obtained diffraction patterns were centrosymmetrized and $5\times5$ binned to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. 
An engineered algorithm which combines the Guided hybrid input-output (GHIO) \cite{ghio} and shrink-wrap (SW) \cite{sw} was employed to reconstructed the images. 
The reconstruction started with an initial support derived from the inverse Fourier transform of the measured intensity. 
At the end of each generation, the copy with lowest $E_F$ is selected, and an updated support is generated from the selected copy.

\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, we studied the interferences of GNPs in CDI experiments, showing that 10-nm and 40-nm GNPs can be imaged as long as more than one GNPs are imaged.

% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the

% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
